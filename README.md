# Backend Developer Challenge

This is a simple challenge to test your skills on building APIs.The ClickBus serivices use mainly Java and Springboot technologies.However, you can use language and framwork that you feel more confortable.

# What to do
```
Create a simple API to manage places (CRUD).This API should allow to:

- Create a place
- Edit a placa
- Get a specific place
- List places and filter them by name
```
```
A place must have the following fields:

- name
- slug
- city
- state
- created at
- update at
```

# Requirements
```
- All API responses must be JSON
- Provide a README.md file with usage instructions(how to run, endpoints etc)
- Provide a testing environment(docker, etc)
```
# Recommendations
```
- Tests, tests and tests
- SOLID
- Code and commits in english(methods, classes, variables, etc)
```
# Evaluation
```
- Project structure, architecturing and organization
- Programming good practices
- VCS practices
```
# Delivery
You musk fork this repository and commit the solution in the solution folder.Your repository must be public.After that, send the repository link on the kenoby platform

Here is an example of how to make a POST request to the `/places` endpoint:

```bash
http POST :8080/places name="Place Name" state="State"
```

# üß™ Testes do PlaceService
Os testes do PlaceService s√£o escritos usando JUnit 5 e o WebTestClient do Spring Boot.

# üêã Docker

1. **Project Compilation**

    The following command is used to compile the project and package the result into a JAR file:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean package
    ```

2. **Building the Docker Image**

    The following command is used to build a Docker image of the project using the Spring Boot:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
    ```

3. **Running the Docker Image**

    The following command is used to run the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker run --name placeservice -p 8080:8080 -d placeservice:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ```

    This will start a Docker container named `placeservice`, map the container's port 8080 to the host's port 8080, and run the container in the background.
